        <h1>Products Of Chocolate</h1>
       <li> Chocolate products usually require the addition of more cocoa butter to that already existing in the chocolate liquor. 
        The various forms of chocolate are available in consumer-size packages and in large bulk sizes for use by food manufacturers
         and confectioners. Most European confectioners make their own chocolate; other confectioners buy chocolate from chocolate-manufacturing
          specialists. For large commercial orders, chocolate is shipped, warm and in liquid form, in heated sanitary tank trucks or tank cars.</li><br>

        <h2>Baking chocolate</h2>
        <li>Baking (bitter) chocolate, popular for household baking, is pure chocolate liquor made from finely ground nibs, the broken pieces of roasted,
         shelled cocoa beans. This chocolate, bitter because it contains no sugar, can be either the natural or the alkalized type.<li><br>
        
       <h3>Sweet chocolate</h3>
       <li> Sweet chocolate, usually dark in colour, is made with chocolate liquor, sugar, added cocoa butter,
         and such flavourings as vanilla beans, vanillin, salt, spices, and essential oils. Sweet chocolate usually
          contains at least 15 percent chocolate liquor content, and most sweet chocolate contains 25–35 percent. 
          The ingredients are blended, refined (ground to a smooth mass), and conched. Viscosity is then adjusted by 
          the addition of more cocoa butter, lecithin (an emulsifier), or a combination of both.</li><br>
        
        <h4>Milk chocolate</h4>
        <li>Milk chocolate is formulated by substituting whole milk solids for a portion of the chocolate liquor used 
            in producing sweet chocolate. It usually contains at least 10 percent chocolate liquor and 12 percent whole
             milk solids. Manufacturers usually exceed these values, frequently going to 12–15 percent chocolate liquor
              and 15–20 percent whole milk solids. Milk chocolate, usually lighter in colour than sweet chocolate, is sweeter
               or milder in taste because of its lower content of bitter chocolate liquor. Processing is similar to that of sweet 
               chocolate. “Bitter chocolate” refers to either baking chocolate or bittersweet chocolate. Bittersweet is similar to 
               sweet chocolate but contains less sugar and more chocolate liquor. Minimum percentages of chocolate liquor are fixed
                by law in some countries, such as the United States.</li><br>
        
        
        
        <h5>By-products</h5>
        <li>Shells, the major by-product of cocoa and chocolate manufacturing, represent 8–10 percent of raw cocoa bean weight and are blown.
         off in the cracking and fanning, or winnowing, operation. They are used for fertilizer, mulch, and fuel.</li><br>

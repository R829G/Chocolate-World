    <p>Introduction From Coco Bean To Chocolate</p>
    <li>Chocolate or cocoa is a food made from roasted and ground cocoa seed kernels that is 
      available as a liquid, solid, or paste, either on its own or as a flavoring agent in other foods.
      Cocoa has been consumed in some form for at least 5,300 years starting with the Mayo-Chinchipe
      culture in what is present-day Ecuador. Later Mesoamerican civilizations also consumed chocolate 
      beverages, and it was introduced to Europe in the 16th century.</li><br>
      
      <li>The seeds of the cacao tree (Theobroma cacao) have an intense bitter taste and must be fermented to develop the flavor.
     After fermentation, the seeds are dried, cleaned, and roasted. The shell is removed to produce nibs, which are then ground
      to cocoa mass, unadulterated chocolate in rough form. Once the cocoa mass is liquefied by heating, it is called chocolate liquor. 
      The liquor may also be cooled and processed into its two components: cocoa solids and cocoa butter. Baking chocolate, also called bitter chocolate,
      contains cocoa solids and cocoa butter in varying proportions without any added sugar. Powdered baking cocoa, which contains more fiber than cocoa butter,
     can be processed with alkali to produce Dutch cocoa. Much of the chocolate consumed today is in the form of sweet chocolate, a combination of cocoa solids,
      cocoa butter, and added vegetable oils and sugar. Milk chocolate is sweet chocolate that additionally contains milk powder or condensed milk. White chocolate 
      contains cocoa butter, sugar, and milk, but no cocoa solids.</li><br>

    <li>Chocolate is one of the most popular food types and flavors in the world, and many foodstuffs involving chocolate exist, particularly desserts, including cakes,
    pudding, mousse, chocolate brownies, and chocolate chip cookies. Many candies are filled with or coated with sweetened chocolate. Chocolate bars, either made of
    solid chocolate or other ingredients coated in chocolate, are eaten as snacks. Gifts of chocolate molded into different shapes (such as eggs, hearts, and coins)
    are traditional on certain Western holidays, including Christmas, Easter, Valentine's Day, and Hanukkah. Chocolate is also used in cold and hot beverages, 
    such as chocolate milk and hot chocolate, and in some alcoholic drinks, such as creme de cacao.</li><br>
      
      <li>Although cocoa originated in the Americas, West African countries, particularly Côte d'Ivoire and Ghana,
       are the leading producers of cocoa in the 21st century,accounting for some 60% of the world cocoa supply.</li><br>
      
      <li>A 2020 report estimated that more than 1.5 million children are involved in the farming of cocoa in Côte d'Ivoire and Ghana.
       Child slavery and trafficking associated with the cocoa trade remain major concerns. A 2018 report argued that international
        attempts to improve conditions for children were doomed to failure because of persistent poverty, the absence of schools,
         increasing world cocoa demand, more intensive farming of cocoa, and continued exploitation of child labor.</li><br>

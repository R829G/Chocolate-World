    <h1>Benefits Of Chocolate</h1>

    Dark chocolate contains powerful antioxidants. Among the most beneficial
     is a flavonol called epicatechin. Flavonols are compounds found in plants 
     that fight inflammation and protect against cell damage caused by free radicals.<br>

    These are just a few of the ways research has shown that dark chocolate can benefit you:<br>
    
    <li>Increases heart health: The antioxidants in dark chocolate have been shown to lower blood
     pressure, reduce the risk of clotting and increase blood circulation to the heart, 
     thus lowering the risks of stroke, coronary heart disease and death from heart disease.</li><br>

    <li>Balances the immune system: Flavonols prevent the immune system from going into overdrive and
     reduce oxidative stress, which is an imbalance caused by cells fighting against free radicals
      and a common cause of many diseases.</li><br>

    <li>Combats diabetes: Epicatechin protects cells, makes them stronger and supports the processes that
     help the body to use insulin better, which might prevent or combat diabetes.</li><br>

    <li>Improves brain function: Flavonols in dark chocolate have a positive impact on brain function, 
    including better reaction time, visual-spatial awareness and stronger memory. Though research is 
    ongoing, one reason for this may be that flavonols increase blood flow to the brain.</li><br>

   <li> Boosts athletic performance: The epicatechin in dark chocolate increases the production of nitric
     oxide in the blood, which supports circulation and reduces the amount of oxygen an athlete uses 
     while engaged in moderately intense exercise. This allows the athlete to maintain workout intensity for longer.</li><br>

    <li>Reduces stress: People who ate dark chocolate reported that they felt less stressed, and researchers
     confirmed that after eating dark chocolate, there were reduced levels of the stress hormone cortisol.
      This may be related to dark chocolate’s effects on heart health, since stress is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease.</li><br>

    <li>With its health-boosting compounds and micronutrients, you should consider letting dark chocolate into your
     life, if it’s not a part of it already (it is important to note that dark chocolate contains caffeine,
      which some people may be sensitive to).</li><br>
    
    
    In the end, indulging in an occasional chocolate treat shouldn’t be fraught with stress or guilt, 
    whether it is antioxidant-rich dark chocolate or white chocolate, which has very little nutritional benefit.
     As in most healthy relationships, the key is to maintain a positive and balanced outlook.<br>
    
    Dark chocolate has many health benefits and can definitely be enjoyed as part of a balanced diet.
     There are many healthy ways to incorporate chocolate into your lifestyle, so find what works for you.<br>
    
    If you need some additional help or have trouble controlling what you eat, consider seeking help from a 
    registered dietitian, nutritionist or other qualified health professional. <br>

 Types of Chocolate
 
<ol> Milk Chocolate</ol><br>

<li>Milk chocolate is perhaps the most popular type of chocolate. It actually contains only 
    ten to 40 percent cacao mixed with sugar and milk (either condensed milk or milk solids).
     Milk chocolate is much, much sweeter than dark or bitttersweet chocolate and has a lighter 
     color and less-pronounced chocolate taste. However, milk chocolate isn’t great for baking
      because it’s prone to overheating.</li><br>

<ol> White Chocolate</ol><br>

<li>White chocolate does not contain chocolate liquor or any other cocoa products besides cocoa butter. 
    It doesn’t have a very chocolatey taste, but resembles smooth vanilla. White chocolate contains a minimum
     20 percent cocoa butter, a maximum of 55 percent sugar, and about 15 percent milk solids.</li><br>

<ol>Dark Chocolate</ol><br>

<li>Dark chocolate contains chocolate liquor, sugar, and cocoa butter. It also commonly includes lecithin as an
     emulsifier and vanilla for flavor. Dark chocolate does not contain any milk solids. The amount of cocoa in dark 
     chocolate bars ranges from 30 percent all the way up to 80 percent. Bittersweet chocolate and semi-sweet chocolate 
     are also technically “dark chocolate,” but are used for baking purposes.</li><br>

<ol>Semisweeet Chocolate</ol><br>

<ol> chocolate contains at least 35 percent cocoa solids, but there are no official guidelines that govern what can be called “semisweet.”
 Semisweet chocolate falls somewhere between bittersweet chocolate and sweet dark chocolate. This type of chocolate is most commonly used for baking,
  but it’s important to follow the recipe to determine whether it calls for semisweet, bittersweet, or baking chocolate.</ol><br>

    <h1>Homemade Chocolate</h1>
    Take some cacao butter. Fill a saucepan with water, set a pot on top of it and bring the water to the boil. 
    Let it boil for some time, then turn off the heat. Shave your cacao butter, add it to the pot and let it melt naturally.
     Then, shave some chocolate paste. It is as bitter as a bark, just taste or smell it. Then smell the melted cacao butter; 
     it’s pure fat. Now combine the two fragrances. It smells like chocolate! <br>

    Anyway, let’s get back to this chocolate making business…..<br>
    
    Melt the cacao paste in the same way as the cacao butter. Now you have the two basic ingredients, but don’t rush. 
    I can understand your impatience, but don’t risk ruining your chocolate.<br>
    
    So, when you take the upper pots where the melted butter and paste are, make sure to wipe away every bit of moisture 
    so that water doesn’t go into the chocolate. And here comes the fun part. Just pour the melted butter into the melted
     paste and give it a stir.<br>
    
    Take that glorious maple syrup and feel free to play and add as much, or as little as you want.<br> 
    
    But don’t stop at the maple syrup though.<br>
    
    Add a pinch of salt and add some essential oils, like peppermint, orange, ginger, tangerine, cayenne – anything you like.<br>
    
    Get your moulds ready, fill them up, pop them into your fridge and BOOM!<br>
    
    This is next-level chocolate guys, made right at home in just a few minute <br>
